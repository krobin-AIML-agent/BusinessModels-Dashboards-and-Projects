The Integrated Manufacturing Schedule (IMS) is a prototype system designed to unify production planning, subassembly mapping, and constraint management into a single, dynamic planning hub. Built in Excel with extensions across Power BI, Smartsheet, and Costpoint ERP, this system provides visibility into manufacturing dependencies, bottlenecks, and forecasting horizons to support MRP and SIOP integration.
This repository contains the artifacts, visualizations, and documentation used to develop the IMS prototype.

üîë Key Features
Schedule Network Diagrams (9+)
Visualized subassembly sequencing, overlaps, and dependencies.
Identified critical paths and alternative build-out strategies.
Bill of Materials (BOM) Analysis
Conducted within Costpoint ERP.
Highlighted shared parts, overlap risks, and dependency bottlenecks.

Constraint Tracking & Action Log
Mapped root causes (material shortages, WIP delays, resource gaps).
Linked actions and ownership for operational continuity.

Forecasting Horizon Module
Built signaling horizons (week, month, quarter, year).
Enabled visibility for long-lead planning and demand shaping.

RACI Accountability Matrix
Defined clear cross-functional ownership across Planning, SCM, Engineering, and PMO.

Dynamic Planning Hub
Integrated forecasting, capacity planning, and visual controls into one dashboard.
Embedded scenario modeling for build-out alternatives and leveling strategies.
