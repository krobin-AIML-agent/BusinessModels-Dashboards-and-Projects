Consulting Engagement â€“ Strategic Planning & Execution Framework

This repository documents a consulting engagement focused on manufacturing systems, ecosystem connectivity, and cross-functional governance. It contains execution plans, diagnostic frameworks, and strategy artifacts built to accelerate operational readiness and decision-making.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives
Build a scalable system prototype to connect scheduling, planning, and operational data flows.

Enable constraint/capacity visibility across subassemblies and product lines.

Develop a tool-integration and governance roadmap for long-term adoption.

Support leadership with visual decision aids (whiteboards, dashboards, frameworks).

ðŸ“‚ Contents
Execution Plan & Constraint Analysis â†’ Prioritization framework to evaluate product line constraints, capacity limits, and dashboard creation for performance tracking.

Ecosystem Integration and Tool Connectivity â†’ Roadmap for connecting Excel, Power BI, Smartsheet, and ERP systems into a single ecosystem.

Smartsheet Implementation and Governance Strategy â†’ Recommendations for automation, traceability, and governance alignment across functions.

Consulting Engagement Whiteboards â†’ Visual brainstorming outputs used to map dependencies, priority alignment, and production planning flows.

Consulting Engagement Strategic Governance and Data Centralization â†’ Framework for data warehouse migration, KPI management, operational job design, and traceability.

Consulting Engagement Action Items â†’ Consolidated task list to drive execution, covering high-level assembly flows, scheduling, KPI development, and constraint analysis.

ðŸš€ Key Contributions
Designed multi-layered execution and governance frameworks across supply chain, program management, and manufacturing engineering.

Created whiteboard-to-digital artifacts that translated high-level concepts into actionable roadmaps.

Built diagnostic and prioritization methods to simplify complexity and ensure traceability.

ðŸ›  Tools & Platforms
Excel (Advanced Scheduling Models, BOM Analysis)

Power BI (Dashboards, KPI Development, Reporting)
