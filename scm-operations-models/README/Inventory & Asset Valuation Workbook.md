This project is an Excel-based valuation and planning tool that tracks both consumables and capital assets. It calculates batch purchase costs, annual spend, and the impact of project-driven demand spikes, while also incorporating inventory turnover to measure utilization.
The workbook centralizes critical data for items such as plywood, nails, lumber, CNC machines, and pallet jacks, helping organizations balance operational requirements, cost efficiency, and financial planning.

## Purpose
- Standardize the way consumables and assets are tracked and valued.
- Quantify annual spend and capital tied up in inventory.
- Account for spiky demand patterns driven by project requirements.
- Provide visibility into inventory turnover as a measure of efficiency.

## Workbook Structure
### 1. SKUs Tracked
- Consumables: Plywood, Box of Nails, Lumber (2x4, 4x4).
- Tools/Assets: CNC Router, Air Compressor, Nail Guns, Pallet Jack, Table Saw.
- Containers & Equipment: Hardiggs Containers.

### 2. Key Columns
- Buy in Batches → purchase quantities per lot.
- Bought Annual → expected yearly usage.
- Price per Sheet/Unit → baseline cost per item.
- Batch Size → units per order.
- Order Cost & Annual Spend → calculated total costs.
- Accounting for Project Spikes → adjusted costs to reflect real-world surges.
- Inventory Turnover → efficiency of usage (e.g., Plywood = 6, Nails = 15).

## Benefits
- Financial Insight: Translates raw inventory into annualized cost visibility.
- Risk Coverage: Models project spikes to prevent underestimation of spend.
- Ops Integration: Adds inventory turnover metrics for performance monitoring.
- Comprehensive: Covers both short-life consumables and long-life assets.

## Use Cases
- Operations & Supply Chain: Plan purchasing cycles and buffer stock.
- Finance: Forecast spend, tied-up capital, and project-driven variability.
- CI/Lean Projects: Use turnover data to measure efficiency improvements.
- Strategic Planning: Evaluate balance between consumable usage and capital assets.

## Notes
- File Name: Inventory & Asset Valuation.xlsx
- Built in Excel with formulas for cost roll-ups and turnover calculations.
- Includes real SKUs with cost, batch, and turnover logic.
