This Excel workbook is a structured framework for building Value Stream Maps (VSMs) and analyzing process performance. It integrates process steps, time tracking, and value-added vs non-value-added classification into a reusable template that supports Lean, Six Sigma, and Continuous Improvement initiatives.

ðŸ”§ Purpose
Provide a standardized tool for creating value stream maps.
Quantify cycle time, changeover time, and delays across process steps.
Identify non-value-added (NVA) activities vs value-added (VA) work.
Establish a baseline and compare it against a future state design.

ðŸ“‚ Workbook Structure
1. Process Mapping Section
Step IDs (PS1, PS2, PS3, etc.).
Fields for process description, delay time, cycle time, and changeover time.

2. Time Measurement Section
Configurable units: seconds, minutes, hours.
Standard work parameters included:
Standard Work Day = 8 hours
Minutes in Hour = 60
Lunch Break = 30 minutes

3. Future State Baseline
Stores baseline process statistics for future-state comparison.
Example placeholders: 250 minutes, 4.16 hours, 14.4 minutes/unit.

4. Analysis & Waste Identification
Above Average Identification â†’ flags processes with excessive delay or cycle time.
NVA/VA Distribution â†’ classifies each process as Value-Added (VA) or Non-Value-Added (NVA).
Resolved Tracking â†’ column to track if issues/waste have been addressed.

ðŸš€ Benefits
Structured â†’ replaces freehand VSM sketches with measurable, repeatable templates.
Data-Driven â†’ quantifies cycle time, delays, and value-added ratio.
Improvement-Oriented â†’ built-in support for future state analysis and waste resolution.
Scalable â†’ usable for manufacturing, service, logistics, or administrative workflows.

ðŸ§© Use Cases
Lean Six Sigma Projects: Document current state, identify waste, design future state.
Operations & Manufacturing: Visualize bottlenecks and reduce lead time.
Office/Admin Processes: Map workflows to spot delays and inefficiencies.
Training Tool: Standard Excel-based template for teaching VSM basics.
