This proposal analyzes resource allocation and workforce strategy for a specialized packaging operation. It presents three options for balancing workload, efficiency, and cost while ensuring compliance with technical and contractual requirements.
Beyond operations planning, the proposal also demonstrates clear thinking in organizational design (how the work is structured) and job design (what individuals do within their roles).

## Purpose
- Evaluate options for supporting specialized packaging workflows (3–5 hrs/day workload).
- Balance PM utilization, employee training, and new headcount costs.
- Provide leadership with a structured decision framework.
- Explore implications for both organization-wide structure and individual job roles.

## Options Analyzed
### Option 1: Project Manager Split Allocation
- PMs handle both admin + unit pack support.
- Pros: Immediate coverage, PMs know codes.
- Cons: PMs underutilized strategically, delayed project response.

### Option 2: Employee Maximization (Cross-Training)
- PMs interpret contracts, cross-train employees.
- Pros: Better staff utilization, skill variety.
- Cons: Unstable demand, limited SOPs, still delays.

### Option 3: New Employee Hire (OJT + SOP Training)
- Hire hourly employee with 13-module training.
- Pros: PMs freed for higher-value work, faster responsiveness.
- Cons: Added overhead, training ramp-up needed.

## Benefits
- Decision-Ready Framework: Structured pros/cons analysis for leadership.
- Capacity Planning: Balances workload across existing vs new resources.
- Process Standardization: Highlights SOP/training gaps.

## Org & Job Design Impact:
- Org Design: Reshapes structure (whether PMs flex or a new role is created).
- Job Design: Changes scope of tasks and responsibilities (split PM duties, cross-train employees, or define a new role).

## Use Cases
- Operations Leadership: Evaluate headcount vs utilization tradeoffs.
- HR/Workforce Planning: Design roles aligned with demand.
- Continuous Improvement: Standardize packaging operations and reduce delays.
- Organizational Strategy: Link resource allocation to structure and role design.
