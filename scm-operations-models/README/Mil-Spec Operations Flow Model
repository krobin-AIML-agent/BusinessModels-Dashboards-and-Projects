This project visualizes the end-to-end process flow for Mil-Spec sustainment operations, mapping how customer requests are transformed into order fulfillment and delivery. It connects customers, requests, fulfillment processes, transportation modes, and end customers into a clear operational structure.
The model highlights daily, weekly, and ad-hoc request flows, as well as the role of administration, packaging, light manufacturing, and shipping in supporting sustainment operations.

ðŸ”§ Purpose
Provide a visual framework for how Mil-Spec operational requests flow through the organization.
Clarify dependencies between administration, sustainment processes, and logistics.
Highlight modes of transportation and their role in connecting operations to end customers.
Serve as a standard reference model for sustainment and logistics planning.
