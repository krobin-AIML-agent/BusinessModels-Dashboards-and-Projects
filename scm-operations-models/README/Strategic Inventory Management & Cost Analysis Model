This project is a diagnostic and decision-support tool for analyzing inventory utilization, tied-up capital, and strategic risks. Built in Excel, it combines Theory of Constraints (TOC) with financial modeling to help organizations identify where inventory is creating waste, constraining operations, and locking cash flow.
The model goes beyond numbers â€” it integrates operational utilization, financial impact, and strategic considerations (forecasting, risk, political alignment) to support continuous improvement and executive decision-making.

ðŸ”§ Purpose
Quantify how much money is tied up in inventory (active, idle, and obsolete).
Identify operational constraints (space, utilization, distribution).
Translate inventory inefficiencies into financial and strategic implications.
Provide a framework for forecasting, risk management, and improvement planning.

ðŸ“‚ Features
1. TOC & Cost Modeling
Calculates part cost, shipping cost, tied-up capital, and opportunity cost.
Evaluates square footage utilization and constrained units.
Links directly to financial statements (cash flow, capital efficiency).

2. Inventory Diagnostic
Flags obsolete, inactive, or underutilized stock.
Identifies risks of overstocking or stockouts.
Measures how much space and money are wasted in idle inventory.

3. Strategic Considerations
Framework for classifying inventory:
Emergency vs Scale vs Tenure.
Considers forecasting horizon (short-term vs long-term).
Incorporates organizational factors (PMO alignment, political risk, support needs).

4. Conceptual Framework Visualization
Visual block structure highlights the layers of:
Stock Room
Ongoing Business
Improving
Designed to evolve into a standardized toolkit for communicating constraints and opportunities.

ðŸš€ Benefits
Financial Integration: Turns inventory into $$ terms, not just units.
Strategic Clarity: Bridges day-to-day operations with executive-level implications.
TOC-Aligned: Identifies bottlenecks and constraints driving capital inefficiency.
Scalable: Can be expanded into EOQ, safety stock modeling, or Monte Carlo simulations.

ðŸ§© Use Cases
Operations & Supply Chain: Identify and reduce tied-up capital in idle or obsolete inventory.
Finance: Quantify inventoryâ€™s impact on cash flow and opportunity cost.
Continuous Improvement Projects: Use as a diagnostic baseline to target process or policy changes.
Executive Decision Support: Communicate operational waste in terms of dollars and risk.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Built in Excel for flexibility and accessibility.
Designed as a plug-and-play framework for diagnosing inventory across product lines.
