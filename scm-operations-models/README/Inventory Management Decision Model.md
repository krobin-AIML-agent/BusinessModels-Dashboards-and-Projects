This project is an Excel-based decision-support tool designed to optimize inventory management by quantifying costs, constraints, and trade-offs. Built with formulas and macros, it provides a structured way to evaluate inventory levels, tied-up capital, and opportunity costs, while incorporating decision rules to support operational planning.
The model helps organizations move beyond gut-feel or manual tracking by centralizing key variables into a single decision-making framework.

## Purpose
- Support data-driven inventory management decisions.
- Quantify the impact of inventory on financials (tied-up capital, opportunity cost).
- Provide a framework to balance service levels, risk, and cost efficiency.
- Enable faster, mistake-proof decision-making through a centralized tool.

## Features
### 1. Core Inventory Metrics
- Calculates inventory cost, shipping cost, tied-up capital, and opportunity cost.
- Flags obsolete or underutilized items.
- Evaluates utilization vs. overstocking risk.

### 2. Decision Model Logic
- Built-in decision rules (via Excel formulas & macros).
- Highlights optimal actions (e.g., hold, reduce, reorder).
- Scalable for both short-term and long-term planning.

### 3. Risk & Constraint Evaluation
- Identifies risks in idle or obsolete stock.
- Quantifies space utilization and resource constraints.
- Links inventory decisions to financial statement impacts.

### 4. Macro-Enabled Workflow
- Automates repetitive calculations.
- Provides structured outputs for faster decision-making.
- Supports “what-if” analysis to stress test scenarios.

## Benefits
- Financial Integration: Connects ops-level inventory decisions to financial performance.
- Efficiency: Reduces time spent on manual calculations.
- Risk Visibility: Identifies tied-up capital and hidden costs.
- Scalability: Can be expanded to include forecasting (EOQ, Monte Carlo).

## Use Cases
- Operations & Supply Chain: Optimize stock levels while reducing tied-up capital.
- CI/Lean Projects: Use as a diagnostic baseline to improve flow.

## Notes
- Built in Excel (Macro-Enabled) for flexibility and automation.
- Designed as a plug-and-play toolkit for inventory analysis.
