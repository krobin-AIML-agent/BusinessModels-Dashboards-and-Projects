This Excel workbook is a structured framework for building Value Stream Maps (VSMs) and analyzing process performance. It integrates process steps, time tracking, and value-added vs non-value-added classification into a reusable template that supports Lean, Six Sigma, and Continuous Improvement initiatives.

## Purpose
- Provide a standardized tool for creating value stream maps.
- Quantify cycle time, changeover time, and delays across process steps.
- Identify non-value-added (NVA) activities vs value-added (VA) work.
- Establish a baseline and compare it against a future state design.

## Workbook Structure
### 1. Process Mapping Section
- Step IDs (PS1, PS2, PS3, etc.).
- Fields for process description, delay time, cycle time, and changeover time.

### 2. Time Measurement Section
- Configurable units: seconds, minutes, hours.
- Standard work parameters included:
- Standard Work Day = 8 hours
- Minutes in Hour = 60
- Lunch Break = 30 minutes

### 3. Future State Baseline
- Stores baseline process statistics for future-state comparison.
- Example placeholders: 250 minutes, 4.16 hours, 14.4 minutes/unit.

### 4. Analysis & Waste Identification
- Above Average Identification → flags processes with excessive delay or cycle time.
- NVA/VA Distribution → classifies each process as Value-Added (VA) or Non-Value-Added (NVA).
- Resolved Tracking → column to track if issues/waste have been addressed.

## Benefits
- Structured → replaces freehand VSM sketches with measurable, repeatable templates.
- Data-Driven → quantifies cycle time, delays, and value-added ratio.
- Improvement-Oriented → built-in support for future state analysis and waste resolution.
- Scalable → usable for manufacturing, service, logistics, or administrative workflows.

## Use Cases
- Lean Six Sigma Projects: Document current state, identify waste, design future state.
- Operations & Manufacturing: Visualize bottlenecks and reduce lead time.
- Office/Admin Processes: Map workflows to spot delays and inefficiencies.
- Training Tool: Standard Excel-based template for teaching VSM basics.
