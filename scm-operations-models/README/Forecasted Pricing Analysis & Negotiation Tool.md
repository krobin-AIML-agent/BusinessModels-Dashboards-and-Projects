This Excel workbook is a comprehensive pricing intelligence and negotiation strategy system. It integrates forecasting, market analysis, competitive benchmarking, and negotiation performance tracking to support procurement, FP&A, and strategic decision-making.
With over 25 structured sheets, the model combines regional pricing forecasts, inflation-adjusted targets, cost avoidance tracking, and vendor/market comparisons, making it a central hub for pricing strategy and negotiation execution.

## Purpose
- Forecast product and service pricing across multiple regions and markets.
- Benchmark vendor pricing against market averages and competitive data.
