This project is an Excel-based decision-support tool designed to optimize inventory management by quantifying costs, constraints, and trade-offs. Built with formulas and macros, it provides a structured way to evaluate inventory levels, tied-up capital, and opportunity costs, while incorporating decision rules to support operational planning.
The model helps organizations move beyond gut-feel or manual tracking by centralizing key variables into a single decision-making framework.

üîß Purpose
Support data-driven inventory management decisions.
Quantify the impact of inventory on financials (tied-up capital, opportunity cost).
Provide a framework to balance service levels, risk, and cost efficiency.
Enable faster, mistake-proof decision-making through a centralized tool.

üìÇ Features
1. Core Inventory Metrics
Calculates inventory cost, shipping cost, tied-up capital, and opportunity cost.
Flags obsolete or underutilized items.
Evaluates utilization vs. overstocking risk.

2. Decision Model Logic
Built-in decision rules (via Excel formulas & macros).
Highlights optimal actions (e.g., hold, reduce, reorder).
Scalable for both short-term and long-term planning.

3. Risk & Constraint Evaluation
Identifies risks in idle or obsolete stock.
Quantifies space utilization and resource constraints.
Links inventory decisions to financial statement impacts.

4. Macro-Enabled Workflow
Automates repetitive calculations.
Provides structured outputs for faster decision-making.
Supports ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù analysis to stress test scenarios.

üöÄ Benefits
Financial Integration: Connects ops-level inventory decisions to financial performance.
Efficiency: Reduces time spent on manual calculations.
Risk Visibility: Identifies tied-up capital and hidden costs.
Scalability: Can be expanded to include forecasting (EOQ, Monte Carlo).

üß© Use Cases
Operations & Supply Chain: Optimize stock levels while reducing tied-up capital.
CI/Lean Projects: Use as a diagnostic baseline to improve flow.

üìå Notes
Built in Excel (Macro-Enabled) for flexibility and automation.
Designed as a plug-and-play toolkit for inventory analysis.
