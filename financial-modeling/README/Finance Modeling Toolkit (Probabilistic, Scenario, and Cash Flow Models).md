This project is a comprehensive finance modeling toolkit built in Excel, covering probabilistic revenue forecasts, scenario-based cash flow projections, and free cash flow (FCF) modeling. Structured as a multi-chapter workbook, it demonstrates how to connect operational assumptions (sales, costs, capital outlay) to financial outcomes (expected revenues, net income, free cash flow).

## Purpose
- Provide a structured learning + application toolkit for financial modeling.
- Standardize probabilistic, scenario, and cash flow analysis in one workbook.
- Bridge operational inputs (price, volume, costs) with strategic finance outputs (NPV, IRR, FCF).
- Support decision-making under uncertainty.

## Features
### 1. Expected Revenue Modeling (CH13)
- Probabilistic forecast: multiple outcomes weighted by probabilities.

**Example:**
- 51% chance → $8.5M revenue
- 49% chance → $1.4M revenue
- Expected Revenue ≈ $5.02M

### 2. Scenario-Based Cash Flows (CH13–CH14)
- Multiple scenarios with probability weights.
- Cash Flow (CF) outcomes from –$52,000 to $247,000.
- Input-driven model: change assumptions → updated outcomes.

### 3. Project Scenario Analysis (CH14–CH15)
- Variables: unit price, variable cost per unit, fixed costs, sales volume, initial outlay.
- Project Life = 10 years with depreciation model.
- Connects assumptions → P&L → Free Cash Flow.

### 4. Free Cash Flow Model (CH15–CH20)
- Standard FCF structure:
- Revenues – Variable Costs – Fixed Costs – Depreciation = Net Income.
- Apply Taxes → arrive at Free Cash Flow.
- Ready for extension into NPV, IRR, sensitivity, or Monte Carlo.

## Benefits
- Comprehensive Coverage: From basic probability to FCF modeling.
- Plug-and-Play Inputs: Change unit price, cost, or sales volume to test different strategies.
- Decision Support: Quantifies the impact of uncertainty and scenarios on financial viability.
- Scalable: Can be extended into valuation, capital budgeting, or Monte Carlo risk simulations.

## Use Cases
- Startup Planning: Test viability of business ideas under different demand/cost scenarios.
- Corporate FP&A: Forecast segment-level revenues and free cash flows.
- Education & Training: Structured workbook useful for learning financial modeling fundamentals.
- CI/Strategy Link: Translate operational improvements directly into financial terms.

## Notes
- Structured as “chapters” (CH13–CH20) to show progression of financial modeling concepts.
- Built in Excel for accessibility and flexibility.
