This project is a comprehensive finance modeling toolkit built in Excel, covering probabilistic revenue forecasts, scenario-based cash flow projections, and free cash flow (FCF) modeling. Structured as a multi-chapter workbook, it demonstrates how to connect operational assumptions (sales, costs, capital outlay) to financial outcomes (expected revenues, net income, free cash flow).

🔧 Purpose
Provide a structured learning + application toolkit for financial modeling.
Standardize probabilistic, scenario, and cash flow analysis in one workbook.
Bridge operational inputs (price, volume, costs) with strategic finance outputs (NPV, IRR, FCF).
Support decision-making under uncertainty.

📂 Features
1. Expected Revenue Modeling (CH13)
Probabilistic forecast: multiple outcomes weighted by probabilities.

Example:
51% chance → $8.5M revenue
49% chance → $1.4M revenue
Expected Revenue ≈ $5.02M

2. Scenario-Based Cash Flows (CH13–CH14)
Multiple scenarios with probability weights.
Cash Flow (CF) outcomes from –$52,000 to $247,000.
Input-driven model: change assumptions → updated outcomes.

3. Project Scenario Analysis (CH14–CH15)
Variables: unit price, variable cost per unit, fixed costs, sales volume, initial outlay.
Project Life = 10 years with depreciation model.
Connects assumptions → P&L → Free Cash Flow.

4. Free Cash Flow Model (CH15–CH20)
Standard FCF structure:
Revenues – Variable Costs – Fixed Costs – Depreciation = Net Income.
Apply Taxes → arrive at Free Cash Flow.
Ready for extension into NPV, IRR, sensitivity, or Monte Carlo.

🚀 Benefits
Comprehensive Coverage: From basic probability to FCF modeling.
Plug-and-Play Inputs: Change unit price, cost, or sales volume to test different strategies.
Decision Support: Quantifies the impact of uncertainty and scenarios on financial viability.
Scalable: Can be extended into valuation, capital budgeting, or Monte Carlo risk simulations.

🧩 Use Cases
Startup Planning: Test viability of business ideas under different demand/cost scenarios.
Corporate FP&A: Forecast segment-level revenues and free cash flows.
Education & Training: Structured workbook useful for learning financial modeling fundamentals.
CI/Strategy Link: Translate operational improvements directly into financial terms.

📌 Notes
Structured as “chapters” (CH13–CH20) to show progression of financial modeling concepts.
Built in Excel for accessibility and flexibility.
