This project is a multi-segment financial planning and analysis (FP&A) system built in Excel. It consolidates revenue, cost, and profitability forecasts across Software, Hardware, and Advertising lines into a unified Executive Dashboard, providing both high-level visibility and detailed line-item control.
The model is designed for scenario planning, strategic decision-making, and long-term profitability analysis covering a 10-year time horizon (2012–2022).

## Purpose
- Provide a structured financial model for segment-level and consolidated planning.
- Support scenario analysis across multiple revenue streams.
- Enable executive decision support via a roll-up dashboard.
- Standardize financial assumptions with built-in validation checks.

## Features
### 1. Executive Dashboard
- Consolidated 10-year view of profitability.
- Total revenues and segment-level breakdown.
- Validation checks (“Clear to Move”) ensuring model assumptions hold.

### 2. Segment Pro-Formas
- Software Pro-Forma → P&L forecast for software revenue stream.
- Hardware Pro-Forma → P&L forecast for hardware line.
- Advertising Pro-Forma → P&L forecast for ad-based revenue.
- Each with year-over-year projections and profitability metrics.

### 3. Master Pro-Forma
- Consolidated roll-up of all segment P&Ls.
- Provides company-level profitability trends.

### 4. Line-Item Detail Sheets
- Software, Hardware, and Advertising all line items.
- Supports drill-down from executive view → granular cost/revenue drivers.
