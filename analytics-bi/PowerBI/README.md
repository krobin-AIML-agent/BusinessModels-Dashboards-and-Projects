👥 Employee Data BI Dashboard (Power BI)
This Power BI project demonstrates a full BI workflow — from Power Query data transformations, to data modeling and DAX calculations, through to a fully interactive dashboard. The dashboard enables HR and leadership to analyze employee demographics, salaries, tenure, diversity, and attrition across multiple countries.

📊 Dashboard Overview
The report is organized into five pages:
Executive Summary → High-level KPIs (Average Salary, Tenure, Employee Count), Diversity Snapshot, and Key Insights.
Salary by Country → Salary distribution and averages across China, U.S., and Brazil.
Country & Department Comparison → Salary inequities by department, ethnicity, and gender.
Role & Ethnicity Breakdown → Intersectional analysis of roles, pay equity, and representation.
Tenure Trends → Tenure band analysis with conditional classifications (Newbie, Been Around, Veteran).

🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
🔹 Power Query (ETL / Data Prep)
Added custom conditional columns:
Age Brackets (e.g., 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, etc.)
Company Classifier (Newbie, Been Around, Veteran)
Cleaned data: removed nulls, standardized categories, and formatted dates.
Split columns and reshaped data to align HR, performance, and salary fields.

🔹 Data Modeling
Built relationships between Employee, Department, Country, and Date tables.
Added a Calendar Table for time intelligence (salary/tenure trends over time).

🔹 Visualization & Interactivity
Slicers & Filters → By country, department, gender, and ethnicity.
Tooltips → Show salary/tenure trends on hover.
Comparisons → Side-by-side salary inequities by department, ethnicity, gender.

📈 Business Value
This dashboard helps:
Executives → Assess global pay equity across countries.
HR Leaders → Monitor attrition, tenure gaps, and diversity representation.
Managers → Drill down into department-level salary and workforce composition.
It demonstrates how Power BI can turn raw HR data into actionable insights for pay equity, retention strategy, and leadership pipeline planning.
