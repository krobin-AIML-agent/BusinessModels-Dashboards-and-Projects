# Employee Data BI Dashboard (Power BI)
This Power BI project demonstrates a full BI workflow from Power Query data transformations, to data modeling and DAX calculations, through to a fully interactive dashboard. The dashboard enables HR and leadership to analyze employee demographics, salaries, tenure, diversity, and attrition across multiple countries.

# Dashboard Overview
The report is organized into five pages:
- Executive Summary → High-level KPIs (Average Salary, Tenure, Employee Count), Diversity Snapshot, and Key Insights.
- Salary by Country → Salary distribution and averages across China, U.S., and Brazil.
- Country & Department Comparison → Salary inequities by department, ethnicity, and gender.
- Role & Ethnicity Breakdown → Intersectional analysis of roles, pay equity, and representation.
- Tenure Trends → Tenure band analysis with conditional classifications (Newbie, Been Around, Veteran).

# Technical Skills Demonstrated

# Power Query (ETL / Data Prep)
- Added custom conditional columns:
- Age Brackets (e.g., 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, etc.)
- Company Classifier (Newbie, Been Around, Veteran)
- Cleaned data: removed nulls, standardized categories, and formatted dates.
- Split columns and reshaped data to align HR, performance, and salary fields.

# Data Modeling
- Built relationships between Employee, Department, Country, and Date tables.
- Added a Calendar Table for time intelligence (salary/tenure trends over time).

# Visualization & Interactivity
