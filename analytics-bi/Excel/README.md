üìû Call Center Data Analysis (Excel Dashboard + RCA)
This project showcases an Excel-based analytics dashboard for a call center dataset. It combines customer sentiment analysis, CSAT scoring, SLA monitoring, and cost forecasting with high-level Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to connect operational issues to customer dissatisfaction.

üöÄ Key Features
Pareto Analysis (RCA): Identified top drivers of customer complaints (Billing Questions = 71%, Payments = 17%, Service Outage = 11%).
CSAT Score Decomposition: Baseline (10.0), actual (5.33), and target (8.5) benchmarked using a custom CSAT scaling model.
Sentiment Analysis (RCA): Broke down VOC feedback into Neutral, Positive, and Negative categories. Linked negative sentiment back to billing, payments, and outages for targeted RCA.
Channel Distribution: Evaluated traffic across Chatbot, Call Center, Email, and Web, with analysis of average call durations and anomalies.
SLA Monitoring: Tracked performance against SLA commitments (Above SLA = 8, Within SLA = 53, Below SLA = 9).
Labor Cost Forecasting: Modeled cost per channel using average durations, rate per hour, and total minutes ‚Üí total labor cost = $919.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills Demonstrated
Excel Formulas & Pivot Logic: Dynamic calculations for CSAT scaling, sentiment splits, and channel performance.
Pareto & RCA Methods: Applied Lean Six Sigma thinking (80/20 principle, root cause focus).
Custom Metrics: Built non-standard KPIs (CSAT evaluation scale, SLA categorization, labor forecasting).
Visualization: In-sheet dashboards with charts for CSAT, sentiment, Pareto distribution, and channel traffic.
Scenario Modeling: Linked operational drivers (billing, outages, call duration) to financial impact (labor cost).

üìà Business Value
Pinpoints where dissatisfaction originates (billing issues, outages).
Quantifies impact of poor CSAT on customer experience.
Provides channel-level labor cost visibility for resource planning.
Bridges operational KPIs with VOC analysis ‚Üí demonstrating how analytics can reduce pain points and optimize cost.
