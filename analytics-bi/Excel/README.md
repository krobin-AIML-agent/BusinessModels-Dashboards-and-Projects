# Call Center Data Analysis (Excel Dashboard + RCA)
- This project showcases an Excel-based analytics dashboard for a call center dataset. It combines customer sentiment analysis, CSAT scoring, SLA monitoring, and cost forecasting with high level Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to connect operational issues to customer dissatisfaction.

# Key Features
- Pareto Analysis (RCA): Identified top drivers of customer complaints (Billing Questions = 71%, Payments = 17%, Service Outage = 11%).
- CSAT Score Decomposition: Baseline (10.0), actual (5.33), and target (8.5) benchmarked using a custom CSAT scaling model.
- Sentiment Analysis (RCA): Broke down VOC feedback into Neutral, Positive, and Negative categories. Linked negative sentiment back to billing, payments, and outages for targeted RCA.
- Channel Distribution: Evaluated traffic across Chatbot, Call Center, Email, and Web, with analysis of average call durations and anomalies.
- SLA Monitoring: Tracked performance against SLA commitments (Above SLA = 8, Within SLA = 53, Below SLA = 9).
- Labor Cost Forecasting: Modeled cost per channel using average durations, rate per hour, and total minutes → total labor cost = $919.

# Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Excel Formulas & Pivot Logic: Dynamic calculations for CSAT scaling, sentiment splits, and channel performance.
- Pareto & RCA Methods: Applied Lean Six Sigma thinking (80/20 principle, root cause focus).
- Custom Metrics: Built non-standard KPIs (CSAT evaluation scale, SLA categorization, labor forecasting).
- Visualization: In-sheet dashboards with charts for CSAT, sentiment, Pareto distribution, and channel traffic.
- Scenario Modeling: Linked operational drivers (billing, outages, call duration) to financial impact (labor cost).

# Business Value
- Pinpoints where dissatisfaction originates (billing issues, outages).
- Quantifies impact of poor CSAT on customer experience.
- Provides channel-level labor cost visibility for resource planning.
- Bridges operational KPIs with VOC analysis → demonstrating how analytics can reduce pain points and optimize cost.
