**🚀 Supply Chain Analytics Pipeline 🔎**

**📌 Project Overview**

**Built a full end-to-end data engineering and analytics pipeline on supply chain data, transforming raw files into a relational database, and delivering business-ready dashboards for supply chain and market intelligence.**

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Data Cleaning & Prep: Power Query, Excel

Database: PostgreSQL 17 (via pgAdmin)

Schema Design & ERD: Custom relational modeling

Data Transformation: SQL (joins, constraints, indexes)

Visualization: Tableau, Power BI

Dataset: DataCo Supply Chain (Kaggle)- https://www.kaggle.com/code/devraai/logistics-data-analysis-and-delay-prediction

**📂 Pipeline Steps**

**1. Raw Data Ingestion**

Imported 180K+ rows, 22 tables, 48 columns of raw logistics data.

Cleaned for duplicates, nulls, and outliers.

**2. Data Cleaning**

Standardized data types and formatting in Power Query.

Performed enrichment and transformations in Excel.

**3. Database Design**

Designed normalized schemas (Supply Chain, Order Mart, World Market).

Built ERDs mapping relationships across:

Customers | Orders | Sales | Products | Suppliers | Shippers | Employees

**4. Data Loading**

Loaded datasets into PostgreSQL.

Applied constraints, indexes, joins for performance + integrity.

**5. Data Modeling & Querying**

Wrote SQL joins/views for:

Delivery status tracking

Order profitability

Late shipment risk

Regional sales trends

**6. Visualization & Insights**

Connected PostgreSQL to Tableau & Power BI.

**Designed dashboards for:**

📦 Sales by Market & Region Profitability by Order

⏰ Time-of-Day sales insights
