# Case Study: Mistake-Proofing MIL-SPEC Packaging Compliance

## Before:
- To procure contract codes, the team had to log into PII, source the correct contract environment, then manually look up dozens of packaging codes.
- They were writing these codes down on sticky notes, then cross-validating against MIL-STD references a slow, error-prone process.

## Problem:
- Redundant manual lookup steps.
- High error risk in packaging/BOM selection.
- No centralized system compliance knowledge was fragmented.

## My Approach:
- Designed a centralized Code Interpretation Tool in Excel.
- Enabled users to simply enter the contract code → auto-translate into packaging requirements (preservation method, cushioning thickness, hazard codes, etc.).
- Applied mistake-proofing (poka-yoke) with conditional formatting and validation to eliminate incorrect entries.
- Structured outputs as bundled BOMs (Method 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) to streamline procurement.
- Deployed a Kanban system alongside to visualize product continuation and validate code usage across multiple contracts.

## Impact:
- Error-proofed the compliance process (sticky note & manual lookup eliminated).
- Reduced data collection time by 49%.
- Simplified MIL-SPEC packaging standards into a one-step lookup system.
