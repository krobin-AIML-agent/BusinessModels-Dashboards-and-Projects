This project is a baseline Continuous Improvement (CI) and Industrial Engineering toolkit that centralizes core operational formulas and process models into a single, plug-and-play Excel environment. Instead of re-deriving calculations or searching for references, users can quickly model capacity, takt time, efficiency, OEE, and other Lean/IE metrics in one place.

Originally created in 2022 as a personal time-saver, this toolkit has since been expanded into a knowledge asset that supports CI diagnostics, operational modeling, and scenario planning.

üîß Purpose
Provide a centralized library of CI/IE formulas.
Enable faster diagnostics without recalculating from scratch.
Standardize analysis across projects ‚Üí reduce errors and wasted motion.
Act as a baseline platform for expansion into dashboards, BI tools, or case studies.

üöÄ Benefits
Plug-and-Play: Simply enter process data ‚Üí get standardized outputs.
Time Savings: Eliminates repetitive formula lookup and calculation.
Error Reduction: Built-in structure reduces chance of incorrect math.
Scalable: Can be copied, tailored, and linked into larger diagnostic or dashboard systems.
Reusable Knowledge Asset: Acts as a baseline template for CI projects across industries.

üß© Use Cases
Operations Diagnostics: Rapidly model cycle time, takt, OEE, and yield in CI projects.
Training: Teach Lean/IE concepts with live formulas.
Scenario Analysis: Test ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù capacity, manpower, or scrap scenarios.
Portfolio Expansion: Serve as the foundation for dashboards, BI pipelines, or case studies.

üìå Notes
Data is flexible and meant to be customized per project.
