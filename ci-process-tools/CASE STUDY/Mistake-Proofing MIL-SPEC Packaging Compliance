Case Study: Mistake-Proofing MIL-SPEC Packaging Compliance

Before:
To procure contract codes, the team had to log into PII, source the correct contract environment, then manually look up dozens of packaging codes.
They were writing these codes down on sticky notes, then cross-validating against MIL-STD references — a slow, error-prone process.

Problem:
Redundant manual lookup steps.
High error risk in packaging/BOM selection.
No centralized system — compliance knowledge was fragmented.

My Approach:
Designed a centralized Code Interpretation Tool in Excel.
Enabled users to simply enter the contract code → auto-translate into packaging requirements (preservation method, cushioning thickness, hazard codes, etc.).
Applied mistake-proofing (poka-yoke) with conditional formatting and validation to eliminate incorrect entries.
Structured outputs as bundled BOMs (Method 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) to streamline procurement.
Deployed a Kanban system alongside to visualize product continuation and validate code usage across multiple contracts.

Impact:
Error-proofed the compliance process (sticky note & manual lookup eliminated).
Reduced data collection time by 49%.
Simplified MIL-SPEC packaging standards into a one-step lookup system.
