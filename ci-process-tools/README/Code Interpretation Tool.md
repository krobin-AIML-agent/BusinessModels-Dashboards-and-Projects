# Code Interpretation & Compliance Reference Tool
- This project is a real-world continuous improvement solution that automates the interpretation of Nefab and MIL-STD-2073 packaging codes. By mistake-proofing the code lookup process and eliminating manual cross-referencing, the tool both error-proofed compliance interpretation and reduced data collection time by 49%.

## Purpose
Mistake-proof the interpretation of preservation and packaging codes.
Reduce the risk of compliance errors in MIL-STD-2073 packaging standards.
Standardize data collection and accelerate decision-making.
Free up team capacity by automating a non-value-added lookup task.

## 1. Features
1. Inputs (Codes)
- PMT (Preservation Method)
- SOS (Sequence of Steps)
- WM (Wrapping Material)
- UC (Unit Container)
- IC (Intermediate Container)
- CUD (Cushioning)
- CT (Cushioning Thickness)
- LP (Level of Protection)
- UCL (Unit Container Level)

## 2. Outputs (Plain Language)
- Auto-translates codes into clear descriptions + MIL-STD references.

**Example:**
- Code: PMT = 41
- Output: Wrapping, Cushioning, Bagging, Exhaust Excess Air, Heat Seal
- Code: CT = C
- Output: Cushioning 3/4 inch thick

## 3. Built-In Compliance Cross References
- Sheets include: MIL-DTL-117H, hazard codes, container codes, packaging references.
- Centralized into one workbook for fast lookup and consistency.

## Real Results
- Error-Proofed (Mistake-Proofing / Poka-Yoke): Eliminated interpretation mistakes in packaging compliance codes.
- Reduced Data Collection Time by 49%: Nearly cut lookup time in half, accelerating packaging workflows.
- Increased Reliability: Clear mappings reduced rework cycles and audit findings.
- Scalable: Reusable tool that can be applied to multiple programs or compliance streams.

## Use Cases
- Operations & Logistics: Interpret codes during procurement or packaging planning.
- Quality & Compliance: Ensure 100% accuracy in meeting MIL-STD-2073 packaging requirements.
- Continuous Improvement: Demonstrate the impact of mistake-proofing and time reduction in compliance-heavy environments.

## Notes
- Based on real project execution data.
- Built in Excel for accessibility, but can be extended into databases or automation workflows.
