This project is an Excel-based analytics toolkit designed to support Continuous Improvement (CI), Quality, and Operations projects. It standardizes descriptive statistics, regression, and ANOVA testing into a single environment, helping teams quickly analyze process stability, relationships, and group performance without needing specialized software.

ðŸ”§ Purpose
Provide a plug-and-play environment for statistical testing.
Eliminate repeated manual setup of descriptive stats, regression, and ANOVA.
Connect process metrics (e.g., resolution time, defects) to customer outcomes (CSAT).
Support data-driven CI decision-making with standardized outputs.

ðŸ“‚ Features
1. Descriptive Statistics
Calculates mean, median, mode, variance, std dev, skewness, kurtosis.
Includes Upper/Lower Control Limits (UCL/LCL) for process stability checks.
Example metrics:
Resolution Time: Avg â‰ˆ 29.7, Std Dev â‰ˆ 4.9, UCL/LCL â‰ˆ 39.8 / 20.2
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): Avg â‰ˆ 5.8 (scale 1â€“10)
Defects: Avg â‰ˆ 2, UCL/LCL â‰ˆ 5 / 0

2. Linear Regression
Tests relationships between metrics (e.g., Does reducing Resolution Time increase CSAT?).
Outputs include regression coefficients, RÂ², and significance values.

3. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
Compares groups (e.g., Do defect rates differ significantly across teams or product lines?).
Provides F-statistic, p-value, and group means for interpretation.

ðŸš€ Benefits
Faster Analysis: No need to re-create statistical tests for every project.
Mistake-Proofed: Prebuilt formulas and outputs reduce human error.
Decision Support: Links process performance directly to customer and quality outcomes.
Accessibility: Built in Excel, usable without advanced statistical software.

ðŸ§© Use Cases
Service Quality: Assess impact of resolution time on customer satisfaction.
Manufacturing & Ops: Compare defect rates across production lines with ANOVA.
Process Stability: Check if metrics fall within control limits.
CI Projects: Standardize statistical testing during Measure & Analyze phases of DMAIC.
