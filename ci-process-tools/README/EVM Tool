ðŸ“Š EVM Tool
This project is a real-world resource utilization and project efficiency tracker built from actual data. It demonstrates how structured monitoring of hours, working days, and resource utilization can directly highlight time saved, capacity gained, and cost avoided in live operations.

ðŸ”§ Purpose
Track daily hours worked across project tasks.
Compare baseline expectations vs actual utilization.
Quantify schedule compression (days saved).
Convert time savings into financial impact (cost savings).

ðŸ“‚ Features
1. Inputs
Budget Hours: 280
Expected Working Days: 45
Hourly Rate: $48/hr

2. Tracking
Daily log of resource hours and team utilization.
Flags for days where team members were unavailable.
Rolling cumulative hours vs budget.

3. Outputs & KPIs
Hours Worked: 229.5 (vs 280 planned)
Hours Remaining: 50.5 saved
Working Days Utilized: 32 (vs 45 expected)
Working Days Saved: 13

Cost Avoidance:
Expected = $16,440
Actual = $11,016
Savings = $5,424 (~33% below plan)

4. Visuals
Line Chart: Hours worked per day
Burn-Up Chart: Cumulative hours vs budget
KPI Summary Box: Time saved, cost saved, % efficiency gain

ðŸš€ Real Results
Delivered project 13 days earlier than baseline schedule
Avoided 50.5 labor hours (18% capacity gain)
Saved $5,424 in direct labor costs (~33% cost avoidance)
Demonstrated improved resource efficiency, enabling reallocation of saved capacity

ðŸ§© Use Cases
Operations Management: Demonstrate efficiency improvements against planned schedules
Finance & Reporting: Show direct cost savings from real project execution
Continuous Improvement: Provide a replicable method for tracking time/cost savings across future projects
Resource Planning: Optimize staffing based on historical utilization vs plan

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Data reflects real project execution records (not synthetic)
Tool was built in Excel for ease of use and transparency
Forms part of a larger Continuous Improvement project portfolio, linking resource management with time/cost savings analysis
