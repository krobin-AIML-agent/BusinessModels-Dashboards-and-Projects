# EVM Tool
This project is a real-world resource utilization and project efficiency tracker built from actual data. It demonstrates how structured monitoring of hours, working days, and resource utilization can directly highlight time saved, capacity gained, and cost avoided in live operations.

## Purpose
- Track daily hours worked across project tasks.
- Compare baseline expectations vs actual utilization.
- Quantify schedule compression (days saved).
- Convert time savings into financial impact (cost savings).

## Features
### 1. Inputs
- Budget Hours: 280
- Expected Working Days: 45
- Hourly Rate: $48/hr

### 2. Tracking
- Daily log of resource hours and team utilization.
- Flags for days where team members were unavailable.
- Rolling cumulative hours vs budget.

### 3. Outputs & KPIs
- Hours Worked: 229.5 (vs 280 planned)
- Hours Remaining: 50.5 saved
- Working Days Utilized: 32 (vs 45 expected)
- Working Days Saved: 13

**Cost Avoidance:**
- Expected = $16,440
- Actual = $11,016
- Savings = $5,424 (~33% below plan)

4. Visuals
- Line Chart: Hours worked per day
- Burn-Up Chart: Cumulative hours vs budget
- KPI Summary Box: Time saved, cost saved, % efficiency gain

## 🚀 Real Results
- Delivered project 13 days earlier than baseline schedule
- Avoided 50.5 labor hours (18% capacity gain)
- Saved $5,424 in direct labor costs (~33% cost avoidance)
- Demonstrated improved resource efficiency, enabling reallocation of saved capacity

## Use Cases
- Operations Management: Demonstrate efficiency improvements against planned schedules
- Finance & Reporting: Show direct cost savings from real project execution
- Continuous Improvement: Provide a replicable method for tracking time/cost savings across future projects
- Resource Planning: Optimize staffing based on historical utilization vs plan

## Notes
- Data reflects real project execution records (not synthetic)
- Tool was built in Excel for ease of use and transparency
- Forms part of a larger Continuous Improvement project portfolio, linking resource management with time/cost savings analysis
