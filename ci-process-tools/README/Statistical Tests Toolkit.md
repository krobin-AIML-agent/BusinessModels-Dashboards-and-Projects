This project is an Excel-based analytics toolkit designed to support Continuous Improvement (CI), Quality, and Operations projects. It standardizes descriptive statistics, regression, and ANOVA testing into a single environment, helping teams quickly analyze process stability, relationships, and group performance without needing specialized software.

## Purpose
- Provide a plug-and-play environment for statistical testing.
- Eliminate repeated manual setup of descriptive stats, regression, and ANOVA.
- Connect process metrics (e.g., resolution time, defects) to customer outcomes (CSAT).
- Support data-driven CI decision-making with standardized outputs.

## Features
### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Calculates mean, median, mode, variance, std dev, skewness, kurtosis.
- Includes Upper/Lower Control Limits (UCL/LCL) for process stability checks.

**Example metrics:**
- Resolution Time: Avg ≈ 29.7, Std Dev ≈ 4.9, UCL/LCL ≈ 39.8 / 20.2
- Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): Avg ≈ 5.8 (scale 1–10)
- Defects: Avg ≈ 2, UCL/LCL ≈ 5 / 0

### 2. Linear Regression
- Tests relationships between metrics (e.g., Does reducing Resolution Time increase CSAT?).
- Outputs include regression coefficients, R², and significance values.

### 3. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- Compares groups (e.g., Do defect rates differ significantly across teams or product lines?).
- Provides F-statistic, p-value, and group means for interpretation.

## Benefits
- Faster Analysis: No need to re-create statistical tests for every project.
- Mistake-Proofed: Prebuilt formulas and outputs reduce human error.
- Decision Support: Links process performance directly to customer and quality outcomes.
- Accessibility: Built in Excel, usable without advanced statistical software.

## Use Cases
- Service Quality: Assess impact of resolution time on customer satisfaction.
- Manufacturing & Ops: Compare defect rates across production lines with ANOVA.
- Process Stability: Check if metrics fall within control limits.
- CI Projects: Standardize statistical testing during Measure & Analyze phases of DMAIC.
