ðŸ“¦ Code Interpretation & Compliance Reference Tool
This project is a real-world continuous improvement solution that automates the interpretation of Nefab and MIL-STD-2073 packaging codes. By mistake-proofing the code lookup process and eliminating manual cross-referencing, the tool both error-proofed compliance interpretation and reduced data collection time by 49%.

ðŸ”§ Purpose
Mistake-proof the interpretation of preservation and packaging codes.
Reduce the risk of compliance errors in MIL-STD-2073 packaging standards.
Standardize data collection and accelerate decision-making.
Free up team capacity by automating a non-value-added lookup task.

ðŸ“‚ Features
1. Inputs (Codes)
PMT (Preservation Method)
SOS (Sequence of Steps)
WM (Wrapping Material)
UC (Unit Container)
IC (Intermediate Container)
CUD (Cushioning)
CT (Cushioning Thickness)
LP (Level of Protection)
UCL (Unit Container Level)

2. Outputs (Plain Language)
Auto-translates codes into clear descriptions + MIL-STD references.
Example:
Code: PMT = 41
Output: Wrapping, Cushioning, Bagging, Exhaust Excess Air, Heat Seal
Code: CT = C
Output: Cushioning 3/4 inch thick

3. Built-In Compliance Cross References
Sheets include: MIL-DTL-117H, hazard codes, container codes, packaging references.
Centralized into one workbook for fast lookup and consistency.

ðŸš€ Real Results
Error-Proofed (Mistake-Proofing / Poka-Yoke): Eliminated interpretation mistakes in packaging compliance codes.
Reduced Data Collection Time by 49%: Nearly cut lookup time in half, accelerating packaging workflows.
Increased Reliability: Clear mappings reduced rework cycles and audit findings.
Scalable: Reusable tool that can be applied to multiple programs or compliance streams.

ðŸ§© Use Cases
Operations & Logistics: Interpret codes during procurement or packaging planning.
Quality & Compliance: Ensure 100% accuracy in meeting MIL-STD-2073 packaging requirements.
Continuous Improvement: Demonstrate the impact of mistake-proofing and time reduction in compliance-heavy environments.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Based on real project execution data.
Built in Excel for accessibility, but can be extended into databases or automation workflows.
